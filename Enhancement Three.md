## Enhancement Three<br><br>

### Databases<br><br>
The artifact that was chosen for me to enhance for database portion of this project is the zoo monitoring program that was developed for IT-145. This is the same project that I made enhancements to in the previous modules. This course was something that I took very early in my program, in 2019, so I thought it would be exciting to look back at this artifact and work to enhance it. In this course we were given the option to include an authentication system or a monitoring system, and I had chosen the monitoring system. <br><br>
The improvement that I wanted to add for this portion of the project was to transition the data that is being accessed from txt files and move them to a database. For this I have decided to use MySQL in order to move this information into tables with the plan on having this be data be accessible via the application. I have created two tables, one to replace the animals.txt file and one for the habitats.txt file. This displays my knowledge of how to create a SQL database and tables.<br><br>
At this time, I am still having some issues getting everything connected properly to the java code. I have been able to add a class to store the connection code to access the database. While I have been successful in the script used to create the database and the tables, I am unsure of how to fully transition from using the .txt files to allowing the database to be accessed and the information be displayed to the user based off their requests. This enhancement has been the most challenging for me, and many of the tutors I have reached out to have also had a hard time with this as well. While this is a challenge I am thankful for the opportunity to learn and grow my skillset.<br><br>
