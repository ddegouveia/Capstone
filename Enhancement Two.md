## Enhancement Two<br><br>

### Algorithms and Data Structure<br><br>
The artifact that was chosen for me to enhance for the algorithms and data structure portion of this project is the zoo monitoring program that was developed for IT-145. This is the same project that I made enhancements to in the previous module. This course was something that I took very early in my program, in 2019, so I thought it would be exciting to look back at this artifact and work to enhance it. In this course we were given the option to include an authentication system or a monitoring system, and I had chosen the monitoring system. <br><br>
The improvement that I wanted to add for this portion of the project was to take the authentication portion that I added last module and make sure that this was now encrypted. This was done by creating a client and then ensuring this was connected. This will help verify that that the username and password exist and uses a hash map in order to help ensure encryption with this private data. This showcases skills that meet the requirements for this project because it is expanding the complexity of the new authentication system and the project overall.<br><br>
I feel that I was able to meet the planned enhancement by adding encryption to the login information. As I move forward with the project I would still like to store data in a database instead of the .txt files that are currently being used to store animal and habitat information. This will help further enhance the projectâ€™s security and efficiency while remaining intuitive for the end user.<br><br>
I found this enhancement to be very challenging because I do not have much experience using hash maps. Much like my enhancements from last module I was able to work closely with tutors to ensure that my project would come together properly. I think that while this project is very challenging it is a good way for me to test my skills and learn more before finishing my degree and continuing to learn knowledge in the world of Software Engineering.<br><br>
